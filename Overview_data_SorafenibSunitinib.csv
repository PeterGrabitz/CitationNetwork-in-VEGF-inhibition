The method involves a two-arm open-label (2:1 randomization) multicenter, randomized phase II trial evaluating the efficacy of sunitinib (arm A) versus no therapy (arm B) in patients with HER-2-negative metastatic breast cancer who achieved an objective response to taxane-based chemotherapy. The results of this study indicates that the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) >5 months was achieved in 10 of 36 patients (28%) in arm A and 4 of 19 patients (21%) in arm B. The median PFS was 2.8 and 3.1 months, respectively. A protocol amendment to the sunitinib dosing schedule was made because 53% (17/32) of patients treated at a starting dose of 50 mg (4 weeks on/2 weeks off) required dose reduction. Changing the starting dose to sunitinib 37.5 mg continuously resulted in dose reductions in 44% (7/16) of patients. Grades III-IV toxicity occurred in 69% of patients in arm A (fatigue 31%, musculoskeletal pain 11%, neutropenia and thrombopenia 8%) and 11% in arm B. The proof-of-principle study does not confirm the hypothesis that sunitinib consolidation therapy can lead to a predefined clinically relevant proportion of patients with PFS of >5 months after an objective response to taxanes.

This phase II, open-label, multicenter study evaluated sunitinib monotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Patients and Methods: Sixty-four patients previously treated with an anthracycline and a taxane received sunitinib 50 mg/d in 6-week cycles (4 weeks on, then 2 weeks off treatment). The primary end point was objective response rate. Plasma samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic and biomarker analysis. Results: Seven patients achieved a partial response (median duration, 19 weeks), giving an overall response rate of 11%. Three additional patients (5%) maintained stable disease for > 6 months. Median time to progression and overall survival were 10 and 38 weeks, respectively. Notably, responses occurred in triple negative tumors and HER2-positive, trastuzumab-treated patients. Thirty-three patients (52%) required dose interruption during > 1 cycle, and 25 patients required dose reduction (39%). Thirty-six patients (56%) had dose modifications due to adverse events (AEs). Treatment was associated with increases in plasma VEGF and decreases in soluble VEGFRs and KIT. The most common AEs were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, mucosal inflammation, and anorexia. Most AEs were mild to moderate (grade 1 to 2) in severity and were effectively managed with dose delays or reductions. Conclusion: Sunitinib is active in patients with heavily pretreated MBC. Most AEs were of mild-to-moderate severity and manageable with supportive treatment and/or dose modification.

Patients and Methods: In this phase III study, patients were randomly assigned to open-label combination therapy (sunitinib 37.5 mg/d, days 2 to 15 every 3 weeks; and docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, day 1 every 3 weeks) or monotherapy (docetaxel 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 3 weeks). Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary end point. Results: Two hundred ninety-six patients were randomly assigned to combination therapy, and 297 patients were assigned to monotherapy. Median PFS times were 8.6 and 8.3 months with combination therapy and monotherapy, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.92; one-sided P = .265). The objective response rate (ORR) was significantly higher with the combination (55%) than with monotherapy (42%; one-sided P = .001).

Methods: Eligible patients received sunitinib 37.5 mg/day and trastuzumab administered either weekly (loading, 4 mg/kg; then weekly 2 mg/kg) or 3-weekly (loading, 8 mg/kg; then 3-weekly 6 mg/kg). Prior trastuzumab and/or lapatinib treatment were permitted. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Results: Sixty patients were enrolled and evaluable for safety; 57 were evaluable for efficacy. The majority of patients (58%) had received no prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. The ORR was 37%; the clinical benefit rate (CBR; percent objective response plus stable disease > 24 weeks) was 56%. Among patients who were treatment-naive or had received only adjuvant therapy, the ORR was 44% and the CBR was 59%. Overall, median overall survival had not been reached and the 1-year survival rate was 91%. The majority of adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate in severity. Forty percent of patients experienced AEs related to measured left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) declines, which occurred more frequently in patients who had received prior anthracycline treatment. Ten percent of patients exhibited symptoms related to LVEF declines. One patient died on study from cardiogenic shock. Antitumor response and several safety parameters appeared to correlate with sunitinib exposure. Conclusions: Sunitinib plus trastuzumab demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with HER2-positive ABC, particularly those who were treatment-naive or had only received prior adjuvant treatment. Sunitinib plus trastuzumab had acceptable safety and tolerability in patients with HER2-positive ABC who had not received prior anthracycline therapy.

In this multinational, open-label phase II study, patients with metastatic breast cancer that had progressed after at least one prior chemotherapy regimen were continuously treated with oral sorafenib, 400 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was overall best response; a secondary endpoint was percentage of patients with stable disease for greater than or equal to 16 weeks. Biomarker analysis were also performed. Of the 56 patients enrolled into the study, 54 were treated with at least one dose of sorafenib. Partial response was observed in one patient (2%) and stable disease in 20 patients (37%); no complete responses were observed.

Patients and Methods The eligible patients had human epidermal growth factor receptor-negative MBC and had not received previous chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. All patients received ixabepilone intravenously on day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle; sorafenib was administered orally twice daily. Patients in phase II received the maximum doses identified in phase I. The patients were reevaluated after the completion of 3 treatment cycles; treatment continued until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. A total of 67 patients were required in phase II to demonstrate increased median progression-free survival from 4.2 to 6.2 months (90% power, alpha = 0.05). Results Ten patients entered the phase I portion; the maximum tolerated doses were ixabepilone 32 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily. A total of 76 patients were treated at the phase II dose. The median progression-free survival was 4.8 months (95% confidence interval, 3.5-6.3 months). The overall response rate was 37%. The regimen was difficult to tolerate for many patients; 20 patients discontinued because of toxicity, and dose reductions were frequent. The common toxicities included neutropenia, fatigue, rash, and neuropathy. Conclusion The combination of ixabepilone and sorafenib was poorly tolerated as first-line treatment of patients with MBC.

Patients had histologically proven, previously untreated, triple-negative adenocarcinoma, with disease limited to the breast and axilla (clinical T1-T3, N0-N2, M0; T1N1M0 excluded). Following determination of the maximum tolerated doses in the phase I portion, patients in the phase II study received paclitaxel 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV days 1, 8, and 15; carboplatin AUC 5.0 IV day 1; sunitinib 25 mg orally daily; treatment was administered for six 28-day cycles followed by definitive surgery.

Eleven patients (27 %) discontinued sunitinib during neoadjuvant therapy, and six patients (14 %) completed 52 weeks of single-agent sunitinib. In the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with TNBC, the combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin, and sunitinib was difficult to administer, and produced a pCR rate comparable to other less toxic regimens.

We hypothesize that low-dose, short-course sunitinib normalizes vasculature, enhancing chemotherapy efficacy. Patients and Methods: In phase Ib, treatment-naive breast cancer patients received four cycles of pre-operative doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide, with sunitinib before each cycle. The optimal dose of sunitinib leading to tumor vessel normalization on immunohistochemistry was identified. In phase II, subjects were randomized to chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus sunitinib at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR) rate. Tumor and functional imaging biomarkers were evaluated serially. Results: In phase Ib (n=9), sunitinib 12.5 mg daily for 7 days before each chemotherapy was established as RP2D. In phase II, patients receiving chemotherapy plus sunitinib (n=24) had similar pCR rates (5.0% versus 4.3%, p=1.00), but a higher incidence of chemotherapy dose delays (33.3% versus 8.7%, p=0.04), compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone (n=25).
