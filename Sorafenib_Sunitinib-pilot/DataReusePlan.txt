Data Reuse Plan

Description (abstract):The project "Sorafenib and Sunitinib in breast cancer" is a pilot to investigate opportunities of citation network analysis to better understand biases in given drug development paradigms. The project was undertaken in the STREAM working group in the Biomedical ethics unit at McGill University in Montreal. The presented data is based on extractions made from 27 identified clinical trials of Sorafenib and Sunitinib in the indication of breast cancer.
